The different roles of the subwindows are as follows:

Top left subwindow: gives a more detailed variant of the
git log output and shows the different commits that have been
pushed. Contains information for the location of HEAD and
the master branch, and also how different commits merge together

Top center subwindow: shows the user that made the commit
and his or her email address

Top right subwindow: provides the timestamp of the selected commit

In the center there are smaller subwindows that give information
about the hash of the commit, and the feature to search for specific
lines in a commit

Bottom left subwindow: shows in diff format the changes that have
been made in the commit selected

Bottom right subwindow: provides Comments and a list of the 
files that have been altered by the commit selected
