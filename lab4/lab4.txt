I was prompted to enter files but I skipped them

9. Using vc-revert I reverted most of the files that were not .c 
files into their original states. For the .c files, I used vc-diff to find
the changes that were made to the files and then replaced them using
C-c C-a to revert the hunks that did not affect code output.

10. cd src
emacs *.c.rej
I found that the *.c.rej contained diff outputs for diff.c and diff3.c.
I replaced the edits with their original lines.

11. I ran git clean -f and got the output:
Removing NEWS.orig
Removing README-hacking.orig
Removing README-hacking.rej
Removing README.orig
Removing README.rej
Removing cfg.mk.orig
Removing cfg.mk.rej
Removing ms/config.site.orig

12. Running git status, I found that there were 6 files being tracked.
#	modified:   cmp.c

git diff > quote-3.0-patch.txt
cat quote-3.0-patch.txt | wc -l
326

I found that there were 326 changed lines for the remaining .c files.

13. export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH
./bootstrap
./configure
make
make check

cd src 
./diff . -
Output: ./diff: cannot compare '-' to a directory
./diff --help
Sample output:
FILES are 'FILE1 FILE2' or 'DIR1 DIR2' or 'DIR FILE...' or 'FILE... DIR'.
If --from-file or --to-file is given, there are no restrictions on FILES.
If a FILE is '-', read standard input.
Exit status is 0 if inputs are the same, 1 if different, 2 if trouble.

14. I copied the relevant src files into diffutils-3.0-patch and the
relevant original src files into diffutils-3.0
Then I ran:
diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch >quote-3.0-test.txt

15. I ran: diff quote-3.0-test.txt quote-3.0-patch.txt > q15.txt
Based on my output, I observed the file contained changes in code
but the changes were in the characters strings. The changes altered
program output and therefore they are not innocuous.
