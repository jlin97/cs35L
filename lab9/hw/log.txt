Assignment 9

I will be working with Carter and Allan for the assignment.

I checked that I had all the required openssh tools on my machine
which were openssh-server and openssh-client. They are both parts of 
OpenSSH which is a freely available version of the SSH protocol 
family of tools for remotely controlling, or transferring files between, 
computers.

I used dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh to check I had both programs.
dpkg, a package manager for Debian, was used to provide information about
.deb packages in the system.

I found I was missing openssh server and I used:
sudo apt-get install openssh-server to install it

I generated my public and private keys using: 
ssh-keygen, which generates authentication keys
I saved the file in the default path with no passphrase.

Output:

Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/jlin/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/jlin/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/jlin/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:OqbSAWwUiy/YogmALqqoy5AF1DhV0rWw3XH4621o6u4 jlin@HP-Spectre-x360
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
| .=+oo.. ...     |
|o+.o..+ o.o      |
|=oo  . o ..      |

|*  . .+   . o    |
|= . .o .   + o   |
|*o ..   +Eo .    |
+----[SHA256]-----+

I then created an account for the client on the server and 
specified the name and password:

sudo useradd -d /home/carter -m carter
sudo passwd carter
Enter new UNIX password: carter
Retype new UNIX password: carter

Afterwards I created a .ssh directory for the new user
cd /home/carter
sudo mkdir .ssh

I then changed ownership and permission on .ssh directory,
which will grant access to Carter to log into the account
sudo chown -R carter .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh

Lastly, I disabled password-based authentication
sudo emacs /etc/ssh/sshd_config
And there I changed PasswordAuthentication option to no

---------------------------------------------------------
The next step is to connect to Allan's server as a client

I generated a new public and private key to connect to the server
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/jlin/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/jlin/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:l+Kuja/mCG5oImHe5O1Dwwo0f+LDlHFrlbti4udy9cM jlin@HP-Spectre-x360
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+

|ooX B o =        |
|++.@ O.= E       |
|+.o.@=B++ .      |

I copied my public key to the server for key-based authentication 
(~/.ssh/authorized_keys)
ssh-copy-id -i jon@131.179.35.162

/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/home/jlin/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
The authenticity of host '131.179.35.162 (131.179.35.162)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:GlWvSnAw4wj6+PEWXApiQjsM7pwECTpUZVCyzW/Ck7k.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
jon@131.179.35.162's password: 

Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'jon@131.179.35.162'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.

During this process, the client is prompted with the public key of the server for manual host 
verification and then the client can add his or her public key as one of the authorized keys for logging in.
The host's public key is also stored in a client's known_hosts file for host validation. This is helpful
in ensuring that the server's identity remains unchanged the next time the client sshs in.

I then added the private key to the authentication agent, which eliminates the need
to enter in a pass-phrase of the account. After entering in the pass-phrase once, the user
will no longer be prompted for it again the next time logging in.

ssh-add

Identity added: /home/jlin/.ssh/id_rsa (/home/jlin/.ssh/id_rsa)

Lastly I SSHed to server with the -X option to be able to run programs 
that needed a GUI
ssh -X jon@131.179.35.162

I tested $xterm, $firefox, and $gedit while connected.
I used $gedit to create a text file in his machine and checked to see
if it was there. It was there.

---------------------------------------------

While Carter was trying to connect to my server I ran:
ifconfig
This gave me information about my current network interface and my IP
131.179.52.114, to which he ssh-ed using carter@131.179.52.114.
