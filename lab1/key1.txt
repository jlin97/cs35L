1. 
man man (After accessing the manual page for 'man', I 
found -k and -K to search for words in manual pages)
man -k remove (I tested out -k with the word 'remove'. 
The command worked and listed out the manual pages that 
had the word 'remove' in their descriptions)
man -K remove (I then tested out -K with the same word. The 
command showed me sequentially the manual pages that had the 
word 'remove' and prompted me on whether I wanted to view 
each manual page individually)

2. 
whereis -b cp (The whereis command gave me the 
locations of the cp and wc commands)
cp: /usr/bin/cp
whereis -b wc
wc: /usr/bin/wc

3. 
find -name '?' -executable (I searched the 'find' manual 
page to find -name pattern and -executable)
I searched in /usr/bin and got:
.
./w
./[
./X
When I searched up the manual pages of the executables,
I found that 'w', shows who is logged in and what they are doing,
'X', is a portable, network-transparent window system, and
'[', is a test command for if cases.

4. 
readlink /usr/bin/emacs (I followed the symbolic link 
using readlink and got to a different directory)
/etc/alternatives/emacs 

readlink /etc/alternatives/emacs (I followed this link 
to see another directory)
/usr/bin/emacs-24.3

5. 	
man chmod (I followed the manual page of 'chmod' to 
understand how to change modes)
g+s grants access to the executable during execution 
as the owner/group of the file instead of the user running 
the executable file. All new files/sub-directories will 
inherit the groupID of the directory rather than 
the groupID of the owner.
o-x grants users that are neither the owner of the file or members 
of the file's group the permission to execute the file

6. 
man find (I read the manual page of 'find' to find -mtime)
find -mtime -21 | head -n 5 (I typed 21 to get all files 
that had been modified in the past 21 days)
My output was:
.
./Desktop
./Desktop/desktop.ini
./Desktop/Google Chrome.lnk
./Desktop/asdf.txt

7.
find -mtime -21 -type d | head -n 5 (I combined the previous 
answer with the -type d to get only directories)
My output was:
.
./Desktop
./Documents
./Downloads
./.cache/abrt

8. 
whereis -b find
find: /usr/bin/find

cd /usr/bin
find -type l | wc -l (I went into the directory that find 
was in and searched for the new lines of symbolic links)
242

9.
cd /usr/lib
find -type f -printf '%A+\t%f\n' | sort | head -n 20

10. man localedef
locale gets its data from the localedef utility
which converts source definitions for locale
categories into a format usable by the functions
and utilities whose operational behavior
is determined by the setting of the locale environment
variables defined in the Base Definitions 
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 7, Locale.
The localedef program reads the indicated charmap 
and input files, compiles them to a form usable 
by the locale functions in the C library, and places the 
output files in the outputpath directory.

11. 
Emacs manual C-h r C-s until I reached sorting section
The commands I found with sort in their names were:
M-x sort-lines
M-x sort-paragraphs
M-x sort-pages
M-x sort-fields
M-x sort-numeric-fields
M-x sort-columns
M-x sort-lines

12.
C-M-a runs the command beginning-of-defun.
C-M-e runs the command end-of-defun.
C-M-h runs the command mark-defun, which puts
a region around the current or following defun.

The other commands do not have a specified function.

13.
C-g runs the command keyboard-quit, which 
quits or aborts a partially typed command.

14.
After killing text, it can be reinserted, and 
this act is called "yanking" or "pulling back" the 
text that was taken away.

15.
I used diff on two outputs of dired and ls -l
in /usr/lib and got that they provided similar information
but in different formats, and dired showed more files:
dr-xr-xr-x. 50 root root    4096 Aug  3 15:08 .
drwxr-xr-x. 15 root root    4096 Dec 22  2015 ..
drwxr-xr-x.  3 root root    4096 Dec 12  2014 alsa
drwxr-xr-x.  2 root root    4096 Aug  3 15:08 audit
drwxr-xr-x.  2 root root    4096 Jun 14 06:36 binfmt.d
and additional information at the top:
total used in directory 4176 available 13963040

dired emulates ls -l on MS-Windows and MS-DOS systems
but has pecularities as dired in emacs is run in Lisp.
